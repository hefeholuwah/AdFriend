# AdFriend

AdFriend is a Chrome extension that transforms ad slots on web pages into interactive, positive content spaces. Instead of traditional ads, users see motivational quotes, activity reminders, and more‚Äîeach designed to inspire, engage, and even reward the user!

## Features

- **Ad Replacement:**  
  - Replaces common ad elements (divs, iframes, images) with interactive content widgets.
  - Skips ad replacement on select domains (e.g., developer.chrome.com, chat.openai.com).

- **Content Types System:**  
  - Supports multiple content types such as **Motivational Quotes** and **Activity Reminders**.
  - Each content type has its own refresh interval and rendering style.

- **Enhanced Interactivity:**  
  - Widgets include interactive elements (e.g., clickable quotes, ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù buttons for reminders).
  - Buttons change styling when interacted with (active vs. completed state).
  - Points are awarded for user interactions.

- **Addiction/Reward System:**  
  - Award points for actions:  
    - +5 points for clicking a motivational quote.
    - +10 points for marking a reminder as complete.
  - Points are stored in local storage and displayed in the extension popup.
  - Potential to unlock rewards like new themes, personalized quotes, or levels.

- **User Progress Tracking:**  
  - Tracks reminder completion count and user points using `chrome.storage.local`.

- **Settings Sync:**  
  - Uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save user preferences such as content type and dark mode.
  - Changes apply immediately and are synchronized across devices.

- **Daily Notifications:**  
  - If no ads are found on a page, the extension sends a notification:
    > "This page is already clean! Enjoy an ad-free experience. üòä"
